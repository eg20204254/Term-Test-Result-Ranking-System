<h2>Term Test Result Ranking System</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The students appear for an examination, and then the results are declared to them for every test. Some schools provide results to the students in the form of rankings, while many schools also provide grading systems to the students. Both systems urge the students to study better next time. If there are a lot of students, each one must be ranked based on their grades. 
  Students who do not reach a minimum limit are declared to have failed. Through this method, teachers can analyze term-test results easily and save time.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

Data structures like trees and arrays are used to create this ranking system for the results of the term test exam. The steps in this application development process are as follows:<br>
- Students’ datasheets will be entered into the database by the user through the command form, and the total marks for each student will be automatically calculated through the function.<br>
-	According to their total marks, their ranking will be lowered.<br>
-	Each student has been given a unique ID (student ID), so it can be used to filter their marks and rank.
-	By using the student ID, the user can update or delete relevant records.
 
The term test result ranking system will include the following functions:
-	insertFunc()
-	searchById()
-	deleteFunc()
-	updateFunc()
-	calcTot()
-	showRankings()

  <h3>Objectives</h3>

The objectives of this project are
-	Saving the students' marks individually for each subject
-	Students can be graded.
-	If there is a correction, school authorities can update the student’s details.
-	Students are ranked by their full marks.
-	If there are a large number of students, the system easily analyzes them to identify the top students and assign them grades. In addition, provide them with scholarships.
-	Teachers can focus on students who are weak in each subject and give them advice.
